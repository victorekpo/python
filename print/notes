In Python2, print was a keyword which introduced a statement:

print "Hi"
In Python3, print is a function which may be invoked:

print ("Hi")
In both versions, % is an operator which requires a string on the left-hand side and a value or a tuple of values or a mapping object (like dict) on the right-hand side.

So, your line ought to look like this:

print("a=%d,b=%d" % (f(x,n),g(x,n)))
Also, the recommendation for Python3 and newer is to use {}-style formatting instead of %-style formatting:

print('a={:d}, b={:d}'.format(f(x,n),g(x,n)))
Python 3.6 introduces yet another string-formatting paradigm: f-strings.

print(f'a={f(x,n):d}, b={g(x,n):d}')
