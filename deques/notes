deques in python
doubly ended  qeue
O(1) - prefered over lists O(n)
append() :- This function is used to insert the value in its argument to the right end of deque.
appendleft() :- This function is used to insert the value in its argument to the left end of deque.
pop() :- This function is used to delete an argument from the right end of deque.
popleft() :- This function is used to delete an argument from the left end of deque. 
index(ele, beg, end) :- This function returns the first index of the value mentioned in arguments, starting searching from beg till end index.
insert(i, a) :- This function inserts the value mentioned in arguments(a) at index(i) specified in arguments.
remove() :- This function removes the first occurrence of value mentioned in arguments. 
count() :- This function counts the number of occurrences of value mentioned in arguments. 
extend(iterable) :- This function is used to add multiple values at the right end of deque. The argument passed is an iterable.
extendleft(iterable) :- This function is used to add multiple values at the left end of deque. The argument passed is an iterable. Order is reversed as a result of left appends.
reverse() :- This function is used to reverse order of deque elements.
rotate() :- This function rotates the deque by the number specified in arguments. If the number specified is negative, rotation occurs to left. Else rotation is to right.  

# Python code to demonstrate working of 
# append(), appendleft(), pop(), and popleft()
  
# importing "collections" for deque operations
import collections
  
# initializing deque
de = collections.deque([1,2,3])
  
# using append() to insert element at right end 
# inserts 4 at the end of deque
de.append(4)
  
# printing modified deque
print ("The deque after appending at right is : ")
print (de)
  
# using appendleft() to insert element at left end 
# inserts 6 at the beginning of deque
de.appendleft(6)
  
# printing modified deque
print ("The deque after appending at left is : ")
print (de)
  
# using pop() to delete element from right end 
# deletes 4 from the right end of deque
de.pop()
  
# printing modified deque
print ("The deque after deleting from right is : ")
print (de)
  
# using popleft() to delete element from left end 
# deletes 6 from the left end of deque
de.popleft()
  
# printing modified deque
print ("The deque after deleting from left is : ")
print (de)
