defaultdict in python
Dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of data values that are used to store data values like a map. Unlike other Data Types that hold only single value as an element, the Dictionary holds key-value pair. In Dictionary, the key must be unique and immutable. This means that a Python Tuple can be a key whereas a Python List can not. A Dictionary can be created by placing a sequence of elements within curly {} braces, separated by ‘comma’. 
Defaultdict is a container like dictionaries present in the module collections. Defaultdict is a sub-class of the dictionary class that returns a dictionary-like object. The functionality of both dictionaries and defualtdict are almost same except for the fact that defualtdict never raises a KeyError. It provides a default value for the key that does not exists.

from collections import defaultdict
# Defining the dict
d = defaultdict(lambda: "Not Present")
d["a"] = 1
d["b"] = 2

# Provides the default value
# for the key
print(d.__missing__('a'))
print(d.__missing__('c'))
